# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

This project demonstrates a comprehensive sentiment analysis using an LSTM model on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. 

## Steps Covered:
1. Text preprocessing and tokenization
2. Building the LSTM model with appropriate layers
3. Training the model with relevant hyperparameters
4. Evaluating the model's performance with metrics like accuracy and loss
5. Visualization of results and sample predictions

## Model Performance:
- The performance metrics will be printed after running the training script.

## Sample Prediction:
- The sample prediction will be printed after running the training script.

## Requirements:
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- matplotlib

## Usage:
Run the `train_and_evaluate.py` script to train the model, evaluate it, and see the results.
